# AZ Watch Subscriber Segmentation

## Project Overview

AZ Watch is a popular video streaming platform dedicated to educational content, where creators share tutorials and lessons on various topics, including language learning, cooking, and playing musical instruments.

In this project, we performed clustering to segment AZ Watch subscribers based on their numerical data. This analysis aimed to establish more personalized and targeted campaigns to reduce subscriber churn.

## Project Goals

- To segment AZ Watch subscribers into distinct clusters.
- To identify characteristics of each cluster for targeted marketing strategies.
- To help reduce subscriber churn by understanding engagement patterns.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python 3.9**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning and clustering algorithms.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and visualization.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation

- **Import Libraries**: Imported necessary libraries including pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib.
- **Load Data**: Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure.
- **Split Data**: Separated features and labels, then split the data into training and test sets.
- **Data Processing**: Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables and scaled numerical features.

### Model Training

- **Logistic Regression**: Trained a logistic regression model to predict subscription status.
- **Decision Tree**: Trained a decision tree classifier and evaluated its performance.
- **Random Forest**: Trained a random forest classifier and evaluated its performance.

### Clustering Analysis

- **Elbow Method**: Applied the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Performed K-Means clustering with the optimal number of clusters (3).

## Results

- **Cluster 0**: Subscribers with moderate engagement time and high frequency.
- **Cluster 1**: Subscribers with the lowest engagement time and frequency.
- **Cluster 2**: Subscribers with the highest engagement time and moderate frequency.

These results provide insights into subscriber behavior, which can be used to tailor marketing strategies effectively.

## Recommendations

- **Cluster 0**: Implement loyalty programs to maintain their activity levels.
- **Cluster 1**: Develop targeted re-engagement campaigns or personalized content to increase their activity.
- **Cluster 2**: Encourage these highly engaged users to become brand advocates through premium content and exclusive offers.
